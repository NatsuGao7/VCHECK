#VCHECK Project
This project aims to provide an automatic process for segmenting the cornea and analyzing the percentage of the specific parts that clinical personnel are concerned about within the entire cornea.

If you had interest, you could read the original paper [SAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643) and [code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

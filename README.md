#VCHECK Project
This project aims to provide an automatic process for segmenting the cornea and analyzing the percentage of the specific parts that clinical personnel are concerned about within the entire cornea.


## First Steps: Using SAM to Segment the Cornea
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cutting-edge AI tool developed by Meta AI, designed to "cut out" any object in any image with just a single click. For those interested in learning more, you can read the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643) and explore the [code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).
They also provide a (demo)[https://segment-anything.com/demo] and you could use this demo to segment the cornea.
